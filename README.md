## Introduction
- The competition was to predict the prices of diamonds based on certain variables using ML models.
- The aim was to find the model that had the lowest "mean squared error".

## Libraries
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn 
- Sklearn

## Process
- I used two different models, LinearRegression and RandomForestRegressor.
- With LinearRegression I made two different predictions, one in which the only variable used was carats, and the other in which all variables were used except colours.
